# Intelligent Web Monitoring System Design

This document outlines a chain‑of‑thought approach for building a robust web monitoring system. The goal is to ensure logical consistency and factual correctness across all stages of crawling, processing and storing data.

## URL Validation and Verification
- Check URL format and components.
- Resolve DNS records and verify SSL certificates.
- Respect `robots.txt` rules before fetching content.
- Test connectivity and handle inaccessible URLs gracefully.

## Content Type Detection
- Inspect `Content-Type` headers and analyze the actual response body.
- Choose extraction strategies based on page structure (e‑commerce, news, flights, multilingual content).

## Data Extraction
- Identify key elements such as prices, dates or article text.
- Preserve relationships in the DOM while parsing.
- Validate extracted values for completeness and correctness.

## Storage Strategy
- Store structured data in PostgreSQL, text-heavy data in Elasticsearch.
- Use Cassandra for time‑series metrics and MongoDB for unstructured documents.

## Intelligent Search
- Analyze user queries for intent and semantic meaning.
- Rank results using embeddings and user context.

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Establish baselines for normal behaviour.
- Detect deviations and send prioritized alerts.
- Apply statistical thresholds to reduce false positives.

## Machine Learning Integration
- Engineer features from historical data to predict trends such as price changes.
- Continuously validate models and watch for drift.

## Multilingual Processing
- Detect content language and translate if required.
- Extract entities consistently across languages while preserving cultural context.

This approach allows each component of the system to interact cohesively, ensuring accurate crawling, analysis and storage of web data.
