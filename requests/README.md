# Request Archiver

This folder contains a simple Python utility to fetch website content and store it locally for future crawling.

Run `python url_requester.py` to open a small GUI. Enter a URL and click **Fetch**. The program saves the HTML response into the `pages` directory with a filename derived from the full URL.
