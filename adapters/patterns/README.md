# Adapter Design Patterns

This directory contains implementations of various design patterns used throughout the adapter system.

## Implemented Patterns

### 1. Builder Pattern (`builder_pattern.py`)
- **Purpose**: Construct complex configuration objects step by step
- **Used in**: Adapter configuration building, search parameter construction
- **Benefits**: Flexible configuration creation, improved readability

### 2. Command Pattern (`command_pattern.py`) 
- **Purpose**: Encapsulate requests as objects to support queuing, logging, and undo operations
- **Used in**: Crawler operations, search requests, error recovery actions
- **Benefits**: Decoupling of request sender and receiver, operation history tracking

### 3. Observer Pattern (`observer_pattern.py`)
- **Purpose**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects for event notification
- **Used in**: Monitoring systems, error notifications, performance tracking
- **Benefits**: Loose coupling, dynamic subscription to events

### 4. Singleton Pattern (`singleton_pattern.py`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide global access
- **Used in**: Configuration managers, error handlers, monitoring systems
- **Benefits**: Controlled access to shared resources, consistent state management

## Design Principles

### Factory Pattern (in `../factories/`)
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related adapters
- **Factory Method**: Defines interface for creating objects
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different creation strategies for different adapter types

### Strategy Pattern (in `../strategies/`)
- **Purpose**: Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- **Used in**: Parsing strategies, rate limiting, error handling
- **Benefits**: Runtime algorithm selection, easy extension

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: All adapters should follow the same design patterns
2. **Extensibility**: New adapters should implement existing interfaces
3. **Maintainability**: Use patterns to reduce code duplication
4. **Testing**: Patterns should facilitate unit testing and mocking

## Pattern Integration

The patterns work together to create a cohesive architecture:
- **Factory + Strategy**: Create adapters with different behaviors
- **Observer + Command**: Monitor and log adapter operations
- **Builder + Singleton**: Configure shared resources consistently
- **Adapter + Template**: Provide consistent interfaces while allowing customization

## Future Enhancements

- **Proxy Pattern**: For caching and security
- **Decorator Pattern**: For adding cross-cutting concerns
- **State Pattern**: For managing adapter lifecycle states
- **Chain of Responsibility**: For error handling pipelines
